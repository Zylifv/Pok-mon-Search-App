# Pok-mon-Search-App
A search app for Pokémon information

This is part of the projects page on FreeCodeCamp which sees you making a search app for Pokémon.
I incorporated some extra flair with things like shiny variants on :hover and will work on changing the type background colors to match the types.

See my CodePen below for a quick look at the app:
